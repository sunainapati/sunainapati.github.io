Hi! I am Sunaina Pati. I am currently pursuing my second year of BSc (Honours) in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). I like reading about algebra, number theory and its application to Theoretical Computer science. I use this site to publish my workings in math and TCS, for example, sharing the lecture notes, some theorems which I found very fascinating, problem sets of classes/tutorials I took and notes on my current reading projects ( for now, I will upload my handwritten notes. I will TeXed it during my summer holidays) etc.

# A little about me
- I am currently reading about Algorithmic number theory, Galois theory, Complexity theory and Coding theory.
- I was a [math Olympiad enthusiast](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/). I have another math Olympiad blog called [Sunaina thinks absurd](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/), with over 100k views where I have discussed over 500 plus math olympiad problems from IMO, EGMO, RMM, INMO, etc. I occasionally lecture on some Olympiad topics in the [Online Math Club](https://www.youtube.com/c/onlinemathclub).
- I love to teach! I was a counsellor ( Teaching Assistant) at [PROMYS India 2024](https://promys-india.org/) and a student in 2023. I have also taught at multiple Olympiad camps ( EGMOTC, INMOTC and STEMS) and TAed a few courses.

# Courses I have TAed/ TAing
- Algebra 2 (Taught by Professor Clare D'Cruz). TAing in my fourth semester of Undergraduate.
- Discrete Mathematics ( Taught by Professor V. Arvind and Amit Kumar Sinhababu). TAing in my fourth semester of Undergraduate.
- Algebra 1 ( Taught by Professor Aditya Karnataki). TAed in my third semester.

# Miscellaneous
- My MBTI type is INTJ-T and sorting hat thinks I am Ravenclaw ( although a few of my friends think that I should have gotten Slytherin). Yes, I am pretty good at communication and talking to people, but I prefer being alone, not disturbed and reading my own things.
- (In case, after talking to me, you thought that I am different from other people socially): I am diagnosed with Bipolar disorder for which I take medications. I also tend to have extreme mood swings on days I accidentally do not take my medicines. My thoughts are very impulsive and are not filtered. Some days I would be absolutely low and not talk to anyone and some days I am very hyper and talking to a lot of people ( including a lot of strangers).
- I love solving jigsaw puzzles ( preferably the ones that are not single-coloured as they are mostly just shape sorting) and nanograms.
- I love doing digital art. I will soon upload a collection of my artwork.
