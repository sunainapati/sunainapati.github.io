Hi! I am Sunaina Pati. I plan to blog about my struggling undergraduate days. I am currently pursuing mathematics and Theoretical CS at CMI. I have completed my first year at CMI. 

**A little about me**:
- I like reading about number theory and its application to Theoretical Computer science. I am currently reading about Algorithmic number theory, Galois theory and Complexity Theory.
- I was a [math Olympiad enthusiast](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/). I have another math Olympiad blog called [Sunaina thinks absurd](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/), which has over 85k views. I occasionally give lectures on some Olympiad topics in the [Online Math Club](https://www.youtube.com/c/onlinemathclub).
- My MBTI type is INTJ-T and sorting hat thinks I am Ravenclaw ( although a few think that I should have gotten Slytherin). Yes, I am pretty good at communication and talking to people, but I prefer being alone, not disturbed and reading my own things.
- (In case, after talking to me, you think I am different than other people): I am diagnosed with Bipolar disorder for which I take medications. I also tend to have extreme mood swings on days I accidentally do not take my medicines. My thoughts are very impulsive and are not filtered. 
- I love to teach! I was a counsellor ( Teaching Assistant) at [PROMYS India 2024](https://promys-india.org/) and a student in 2023, and I have taught in multiple Olympiad camps and TAed a few courses.
- I love jigsaw puzzles ( preferably the ones which are not single coloured as then it is mostly just shape sorting).

**Note**: If I am TAing your course, please ask me questions regarding coursework and problems. I prefer if you ask me over email as I might be busy solving my own problems/ reading my own coursework. I will try to answer you in a few hours ( whenever I see your email).
- My grading is in general very lenient and I do not cut marks for silly calculation errors or some typos ( unless the professor has asked me to grade harshly). So do not worry about that!

**Courses I have TAed/ TAing**:
- Algebra 2 (Taught by Professor Clare D'Cruz). TAing in my fourth semester of Undergraduate.
- Discrete Mathematics ( Taught by Professor V. Arvind and Amit Kumar Sinhababu). TAing in my fourth semester of Undergraduate.
- Algebra 1 ( Taught by Professor Aditya Karnataki). TAed in my third semester.
