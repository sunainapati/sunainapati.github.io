Hi, I am Sunaina Pati, a math student who loves number theory, algebra, and theoretical computer science, and who sees math through a uniquely neurodivergent lens. I am currently in my second year of the BSc (Hons) Mathematics and Computer Science program at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/).

This site is my little archive of thought, a space where I share the things I do every day with everyone :)

# My Coordinates in the Mathematical World
An intro to my journey through math and theoretical CS — what I study, love, and work on.
- I am currently reading about Class Field theory, Complexity Theory, and Coding Theory.
- I was a [math Olympiad enthusiast](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/)  and I still love thinking about beautiful problems. I’ve written over 500 Olympiad problems (IMO, EGMO, RMM, INMO, etc.) on my old blog [Sunaina thinks absurd](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/), which has over 100k views!
- I love teaching! I was a counsellor (Teaching Assistant) at [PROMYS India 2024](https://promys-india.org/) and a student there in 2023. I’ve also lectured at multiple Olympiad camps (EGMOTC, INMOTC, STEMS) and TAed a few undergraduate courses.

# Courses I've TAed/ TAing
- Algebra 3 - Taught by Professor Clare D'Cruz (Upcoming semester)
- Algebra 2 - Taught by Professor Clare D'Cruz (Past)
- Discrete Mathematics - Taught by Professors V. Arvind and Amit Kumar Sinhababu (Past)
- Algebra 1 - Taught by Professor Aditya Karnataki (Past)


# The Sunaina Debug Log
Here’s a little debug log of constants and quirks in my personality.
- My MBTI type is ENTJ-T, and the Sorting Hat put me in Ravenclaw (though a few friends insist I should’ve been in Slytherin). I am social, but I deeply value my quiet time — thinking, reading, and exploring things on my own.
- I enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles, preferably not single-colored ones (those are more shape sorting than fun!) and nonograms.
- I love doing digital art. Check out my artwork page if you want to see some of my artworks!
