Hi! I am Sunaina Pati. I am currently pursuing mathematics and Theoretical CS at CMI. I have completed my first year at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). I like reading about number theory and its application to Theoretical Computer science. I use this site to publish my workings in math and TCS, for example, sharing the lecture notes, some theorems which found very fascinating, notes to my current reading projects, problem sets of classes/tutorials I took, etc. I will soon upload proper notes on this site.

# A little about me
- I am currently reading about Algorithmic number theory, Galois theory and Complexity Theory.
- I was a [math Olympiad enthusiast](https://www.egmo.org/people/person2282/). I have another math Olympiad blog called [Sunaina thinks absurd](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/), with over 85k views where I have discussed over 500 plus math olympiad problems from IMO, EGMO, RMM, INMO, etc. I occasionally lecture on some Olympiad topics in the [Online Math Club](https://www.youtube.com/c/onlinemathclub).
- I love to teach! I was a counsellor ( Teaching Assistant) at [PROMYS India 2024](https://promys-india.org/) and a student in 2023, and I have taught in multiple Olympiad camps and TAed a few courses.


# Courses I have TAed/ TAing
- Algebra 2 (Taught by Professor Clare D'Cruz). TAing in my fourth semester of Undergraduate.
- Discrete Mathematics ( Taught by Professor V. Arvind and Amit Kumar Sinhababu). TAing in my fourth semester of Undergraduate.
- Algebra 1 ( Taught by Professor Aditya Karnataki). TAed in my third semester.
Note to students attending courses I am TAing:
- Note 1: If I am TAing your course, please feel free to ask me questions regarding coursework and problems. I prefer if you ask me over email as I might be busy solving my own problems/ reading my own coursework. I will try to answer you in a few hours ( whenever I see your email).
- Note 2: My grading is in general very lenient and I do not cut marks for silly calculation errors or some typos ( unless the professor has asked me to grade harshly). So do not worry about that!

# Miscellaneous
- My MBTI type is INTJ-T and sorting hat thinks I am Ravenclaw ( although a few of my friends think that I should have gotten Slytherin). Yes, I am pretty good at communication and talking to people, but I prefer being alone, not disturbed and reading my own things.
- (In case, after talking to me, you thought that I am different from other people socially): I am diagnosed with Bipolar disorder for which I take medications. I also tend to have extreme mood swings on days I accidentally do not take my medicines. My thoughts are very impulsive and are not filtered. Some days I would be absolutely low and not talk to anyone and some days I am very hyper and talking to a lot of people ( including a lot of strangers).
- I love solving jigsaw puzzles ( preferably the ones that are not single-coloured as they are mostly just shape sorting).
