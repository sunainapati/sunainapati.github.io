Hi! I am Sunaina Pati. I plan to blog about my struggling undergraduate days. I am currently pursuing mathematics and Theoretical CS at CMI. I have completed my first year at CMI. I plan to use this blog to update my progress in higher math and Computer science. I will also use it to update my life, progress, and struggles during my undergraduate studies. I will be posting notes and discussing problems here. 

A little about me:
- I like number theory and its application to Theoretical Computer science. I am currently reading Algebraic and Algorithmic Number theory. I plan to read much more
- I love listening to Progressive rock and metal ( My favourite bands are Polyphia, Unprocessed and Bad Omens)
I was a math Olympiad enthusiast. I have another math Olympiad blog called [Sunaina thinks absurd](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/), which has over 80k views. I occasionally give lectures on some Olympiad topics.
- My MBTI type is INTJ-T and sorting hat thinks I am Ravenclaw ( although a few think I am Slytherin)
