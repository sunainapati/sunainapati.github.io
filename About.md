Hi! I am Sunaina Pati. I plan to blog about my struggling undergraduate days. I am currently pursuing mathematics and Theoretical CS at CMI. I have completed my first year at CMI. I plan to use this blog to update my progress in higher math and Computer science. I will also use it to update my life, progress, and struggles during my undergraduate studies. I will be posting notes and discussing problems here. 

A little about me:
- I would describe myself as a math and theoretical CS enthusiast, who likes learning new theories and applying them to various problems. 
- I love listening to K-Pop, Indian Indies, J-Pop and some 2010s bollywood songs
- I have another math blog called [Sunaina thinks absurd](https://sunainalovesmath.blogspot.com/) which has over 70k views.
- My MBTI type is INTJ-T
