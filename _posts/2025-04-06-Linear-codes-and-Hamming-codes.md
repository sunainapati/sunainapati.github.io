# Linear Codes

Recall that a block code $\mathcal{C}$ is an arbitrary subset of $\Sigma^n$. Such codes may have no algebraic structure, making it computationally hard to verify whether a given string is a codeword. This motivates the study of \emph{linear codes}, which impose additional structure that allows for efficient encoding and decoding.

To define linear codes formally, we assume that the alphabet $\Sigma$ is a finite field $\F_q$. Then the ambient space $\F_q^n$ is a vector space of dimension $n$ over $\F_q$. A linear code is simply a subspace of this vector space.

## Definition 

A linear code $\C \subseteq \F_q^n$ is called an $[n, k, d]_q$ linear code if:
- $\C$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\F_q^n$
- The minimum (Hamming) distance between any two distinct codewords in $\C$ is $d$

Equivalently, $\C$ is closed under linear combinations: if $x, y \in \C$ and $\alpha, \beta \in \F_q$, then $\alpha x + \beta y \in \C$.

## Interpretation of Parameters 

An $[n, k, d]_q$ code encodes $k$ symbols (message length) as $n$ symbols (codeword length), thereby introducing redundancy to allow for error correction.

- $k$: Number of message symbols  
- $n$: Length of the codeword  
- $d$: Minimum distance between any two codewords — the code can detect up to $d - 1$ errors and correct up to $\left\lfloor \frac{d - 1}{2} \right\rfloor$ errors

In practice, we aim to maximize both $k$ (rate) and $d$ (error protection), but these are in tension with each other.

## Example: Repetition Code

Let $\F_2 = \{0, 1\}$ and consider the code:  
$$
\C = \{(0,0,0), (1,1,1)\}.
$$
This is a $[3, 1, 3]_2$ linear code. It is a 1-dimensional subspace of $\F_2^3$ (generated by $(1,1,1)$), and the minimum distance is 3.

# Hamming Weight 

**Definition:** The \emph{Hamming weight} of a vector $x \in \F_q^n$ is the number of nonzero entries:  
$$
\wt(x) = \left| \{ i \in \{1, \dots, n\} \mid x_i \neq 0 \} \right|.
$$
In binary codes, this counts the number of 1s in $x$.

In linear codes, the minimum distance is the minimum weight among all **nonzero** codewords:
$$
d = \min \{ \wt(x) \mid x \in \C,\ x \neq 0 \}.
$$

# Claim: Distance = Minimum Weight (for linear codes)

**Claim:** If $\C$ is a linear code, then  
$$
d(\C) = \min_{x \in \C \setminus \{0\}} \wt(x).
$$

**Proof:** By definition,  
$$
d(\C) = \min_{\substack{x, y \in \C \\ x \neq y}} d(x, y).
$$
But since $\C$ is linear, $x - y \in \C$ and $d(x, y) = \wt(x - y)$. So:  
$$
d(\C) = \min_{z \in \C \setminus \{0\}} \wt(z).
$$

# Parity-Check Matrix

Suppose $\C \subseteq \F_q^n$ is a $k$-dimensional linear code. To test whether a vector $x \in \F_q^n$ is a codeword, we can construct a matrix $H$ such that:  
$$
Hx = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad x \in \C.
$$
This matrix $H$ is called the \emph{parity-check matrix}.

## Constructing $H$

- Extend a basis $\{b_1, \dots, b_k\}$ of $\C$ to a full basis $\{b_1, \dots, b_n\}$ of $\F_q^n$.
- Define $H$ to be the linear map that sends:
  - $b_1, \dots, b_k \mapsto 0$
  - $b_{k+1}, \dots, b_n \mapsto$ identity

Then $H(x) = 0$ iff $x \in \C$.

\subsection*{Matrix Form}

Let $B = [b_1 | b_2 | \dots | b_n]$ be the $n \times n$ matrix. Define:  
$$
\hat{H} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{0}_{(n-k) \times k} & I_{(n-k) \times (n-k)}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Then:  
$$
H = \hat{H} B^{-1}
$$
and this satisfies: $Hx = 0$ iff $x \in \C$.

# Generator Matrix

A generator matrix $G$ of an $[n, k, d]_q$ code is a $k \times n$ matrix such that:  
$$
\C = \{ mG \mid m \in \F_q^k \}
$$
This provides an efficient encoding mechanism: message $m$ is encoded as $c = mG$.

# Example: $[7,4,3]$ Hamming Code

This is a binary code that maps 4-bit messages to 7-bit codewords. It can correct single-bit errors.

## Generator Matrix

$$
G = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

\subsection*{Parity-Check Matrix}

$$
H = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Each column of $H$ is a nonzero vector in $\F_2^3$, ensuring that $d = 3$.

## Definition: Binary Hamming Code

For $r \geq 2$, the binary Hamming code $\mathcal{H}_r$ is a linear code over $\F_2$ with parameters:  
$$
[n = 2^r - 1,\; k = 2^r - 1 - r,\; d = 3]
$$

The parity-check matrix $H$ is of size $r \times n$, and its columns are all nonzero binary vectors of length $r$ — each appearing exactly once.
