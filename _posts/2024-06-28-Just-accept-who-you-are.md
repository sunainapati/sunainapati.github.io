_title: Just accept who you are
---
I was talking to a friend of mine. This was during our bad performance during the Algebra exam. She said, "it's okay, we are born with less mathematical maturity." No, it's because our way of studying isn't the best. I am not going to accept the fact ever that I am just not smart enough. 
If anything, I will show her that I am the smartest. Be ready people. This is going to be my best ever comeback. BEST EVER. I will show it to everyone. Including CMI. That place made my living a hell. It degraded my mental health. You know what everyone? I will make that place a living hell for everyone who contributed in it. I will show you my real INTJ.
